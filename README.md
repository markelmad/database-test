# Database Test

This is a MySQL Database test that run on localhost with port 3306. Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting happens via URL using queries.

The Database contains data from the previous test which is about Shakespearse's works. I also added a couple of unit testing to test possible queries.

URL testing will be test using a mock server. However, the database will be the actual one. Creating a mock database requires an external dependency which is not allowed.
